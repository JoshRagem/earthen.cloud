        <span class="col c7">this is some longer text I don't care about wrapping lines in my text editor because all computers nowadays have very wide screens and there is no real point to arbitrary wrapping by the typist because editors do all that for you. Even (especially) in programming I enjoy long lines so long as they are still just one item -- no need to painfully wrap awkward function calls or data structures just because they don't fit in 80 colomns -- write the code to represent want you mean instead of conforming to non-existant restrictions.</span>
