### Hunter-Gatherers in the Age of Agricultural Programming

_Sep 22, 2017_

A recent interview experience reminded me of the rise of agriculture and the ever increasing specialization of human activity.

# Rise of Agriculture

## before

A hunter-gatherer must have all the skills necessary for survival:

* identify food
* find prey
* kill prey
* defend self and family
* build/find shelter
* navigation
* knowledge of weather and seasons

Any individual lacking in one of these skills would be a drain on their group--this could lead to the failure of an entire family unit.

## after

A human living in a world with agriculture has a different and more specialized set of skills. The skills needed to survive today seem to change by decade. Commerce, technology (especially the internet), and education enable humans to be successful in such bizarrely specific skill sets as fast food copy-writer and olympic weight-lifter.

These modern skill sets are related in some ways to the hunter-gatherer skills, but they are so far removed that they would be of little practical use. Humans have created a different world from the one where they started.
